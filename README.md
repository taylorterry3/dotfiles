dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

All the usual suspects are here, along with machine_setup.sh for setting up a standard workstation on Ubuntu and machine_setup_osx.sh for doing the same via homebrew on OSX. Most of this works with cygwin as well.

Caveat praedor: I generally push small changes straight to main.

Note the dependency on .bashrc_private, which needs to be copied in by hand. That's where I keep semi-sensitive stuff like server aliases.
